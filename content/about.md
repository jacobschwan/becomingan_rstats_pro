# It's About the Process

Like many, I'm working my way into the data science world. I've been learning R over the last few years and have fallen in love with it and the powerful tools people create for it. I've learned a lot, but haven't had much opportunity to receive feedback or critique. That's where this blog comes in. 

It's about the process. It'll be a tool to track learning and practice publishing and sharing.  Hopefully, if you're taking the time to read it, you'll also be nice enough to post constructive comments and help me become a better coder, writer, and analyst.

This site was created using the fantastic [blogdown](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/blogdown/index.html) package for R.  The companion book, [blogdown: Creating Websites with RMarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), was a great primer.
