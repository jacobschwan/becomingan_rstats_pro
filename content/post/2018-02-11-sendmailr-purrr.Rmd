I use R in my day job to generate and send out regular reports. The [sendmailR]() package has been great to automatically email an output file.  However, it becomes increasingly annoying to attach multiple files to an email. Each file is defined as a separate `mime_part()` object with a file name and path, then added to a list with

Or, at least it was, before I started using the `purrr` package.

## TL;DR

Here's the code template I use to send an email will all of the files in a specific folder.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(sendmailR)
folder_name <- ""
email_from <- "<>"
email_to <- c("<>", "<>")
email_bcc <- "<>"
email_subject <- ""
email_body <- ""

output_files <- data.frame(filename = list.files(folder_name),
                           file_path = list.files(folder_name, full.names = T),
                           stringsAsFactors = F)

email_attachments <- purrr::map2(output_files$file_path,
                                 output_files$filename,
                                 mime_part)

sendmail(from = email_from,
         to = email_to,
         bcc = email_bcc,
         subject = email_subject,
         msg = c(email_body, email_attachments),
         control = list(smtpServer = ""))
```
